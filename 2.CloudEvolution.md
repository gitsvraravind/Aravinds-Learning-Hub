
The Evolution of Computing​
Dedicated

    A physical server ​wholly utilized by a single customer​.
    You have to guess your capacity​
    You’ll overpay for an underutilized server ​
    You can’t vertical scale, you need a manual migration​
    Replacing a server is very difficult​
    You are limited by your Host Operating System​
    Multiple apps can result in conflicts in resource sharing​
    You have a ​guarantee of security, privacy, and full utility of underlying resources​

VMs

    You can run ​multiple Virtual Machines on one machine.​​
    ​Hypervisor​ is the software layer that lets you run the VMs​
    A physical server shared by multiple customers​
    You are to pay for a fraction of the server​
    You’ll overpay for an underutilized Virtual Machine ​
    You are limited by your Guest Operating System​
    Multiple apps on a single Virtual Machine can result in conflicts in resource sharing​
    Easy to export or import images for migration​
    Easy to Vertically or Horizontally scale​

Containers

    Virtual Machine running multiple containers​
    ​Docker Daemon​ is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers.​
    You can maximize the utilization of the available capacity which is more cost-effective​
    Your containers share the same underlying OS so containers are more efficient than multiple VMs​
    Multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same OS requirements and will not cause conflicts during resource sharing​

Functions

    Functions are managed VMs running managed containers.​
    Known as ​Serverless Compute​​
    You upload a piece of code, choose the amount of memory and duration. ​
    Only responsible for code and data, nothing else​
    Very cost-effective, only pay for the time code is running, VMs only run when there is code to be executed​
    Cold Starts is a side-effect of this setup​


    Types of Cloud Computing
    
Cloud Computing models
There are three main models of Cloud Computing:

    SaaS - Software as a Service
    PaaS- Platform as a Service
    IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service

#### SaaS- Software as a Service (Consume)

Completed projects managed by a service provider. Easy to use and comes complete with a user interface. Least flexibility

Examples:

    Gmail
    Adobe Creative Cloud

#### PaaS- Platform as a Service (Build)

Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Less flexibility than IaaS because of pre-constructed packages.

Examples:

    AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    Windows Azure
    Heroku
    Google App Engine

#### IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service (Host)

Most basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure. It has the most flexibility and management control of all the different cloud computing models. It is the closest to having a traditional on-premises data center. 

Examples:

    Amazon EC2 
    Azure Virtual Machines
    Google Compute Engine
