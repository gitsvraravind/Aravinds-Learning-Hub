What is a Cloud Service Provider?

A Cloud Service Provider - is a company which provides multiple Cloud Services, ​and those Cloud Services can be chained together to create cloud architectures​

Most commonly through internet-hosted computing, storage, and software services.
The Big Three Service Providers

There are three main cloud service providers that own the market share. These providers and their market share are:

    Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    Microsoft Azure 
    Google Cloud Platform

Common Cloud Services

    Compute​ - Imagine having a virtual computer that​ can run applications, programs, and code.
    Networking​ - Imagine having a virtual network that allows you to define internet connections or network isolations
    Storage​- Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that​ can store files
    Databases​ - Imagine a virtual database for storing and reporting data or a database for general-purpose web-application

    Note: - AWS has over 200+ cloud services

The term “Cloud Computing” can be used to refer to all categories, even though it has “compute” in the name.



Landscape of CSPs

Tier-1 (Top Tier) – Early to market, wide offering, strong synergies between services, well recognized in the industry

    Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    Microsoft Azure
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    Alibaba Cloud

Tier-2 (Mid Tier) – Backed by well-known tech companies, slow to innovate and turned to specialization.

    IBM Cloud
    Oracle Cloud

A cloud provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services.

The four most common types of cloud services for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:

    Compute​ - Imagine having a virtual computer that​ can run applications, programs, and code.
    Networking​ - Imagine having a virtual network that allows you to define internet connections or network isolations
    Storage​- Imagine having a virtual hard drive that​ can store files
    Databases​ - Imagine a virtual database for storing and reporting data or a database for general-purpose web-application
