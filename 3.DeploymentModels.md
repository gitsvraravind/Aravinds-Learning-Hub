
Cloud Computing Deployment Models

There are three different types of deployment models for Cloud Computing.
Cloud

When you think of Cloud, think of small startups.
Cloud Deployment

    100% of IT infrastructure is on the cloud.
    All of a companies applications were migrated to or created on the cloud.
    Helps to remove roadblocks of costly and time consuming procurement processes for on-premises infrastructure (big servers and data centers!).
    Great for small businesses and start-ups.

Hybrid

When you think of Hybrid, think of Fin Tech Companies
Hybrid Deployment

    Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources
    Great for established companies that had a dedicated data center but also wants to migrate processes over to the cloud
    Data is partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises
    Popular in the Fin Tech space

On-Premise

When you think of On-premise, think of large old companies or companies that are beholden to Government Regulations.
On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment

    Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers.
    Resembles traditional IT infrastructure with big servers, data centers, etc.
    Do not get the same benefits of cloud computing (ability to easily scale up and down on demand)
    Company has dedicated resources that are not shared with others(good for security)
    Resources cannot be accessed using the internet
    Typically older large companies or owned by Government organizations


When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:

    The information and data stored in the cloud
    Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
    The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:

    The physical datacenter
    The physical network
    The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

    Operating systems
    Network controls
    Applications
    Identity and infrastructure


Reference

What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

Private cloud

     A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter.
     It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity.
     Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department.
     It also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. 
     Private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter.It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite or by third party.
     
Public cloud

    A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
    With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. 
    The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.

Hybrid cloud

    A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
    A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. 
    Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to     deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

Multi-cloud

    A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. 
    In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. 
    Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. 
    Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider.
    Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

    Maximum acceptable amount of time a system or application can be offline after a failure of disaster. 
    A server crash occurs at 10 AM and the IT team restores the system by 11.45 a, staying within the 2 hours RTO.
    A bank online transcation system has a RTO of 2 hours and it means that the bank must restore the system within 2 hours of a failure to avoid significant business impact.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

    Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measure in time. It indicates how far back in time the data must be recovered . 
    A database failure occurs at 3 PM and the data is restored from a backup taken at 2.45 pm ensuring data loss is withing the 15 minute RPO.
